### YouTube Compatibility

When using YouTube, the extension automatically adjusts its overlay to:

- Maintain video player visibility
- Use a screen blend mode for better color visibility

## Tips

- Use the time display toggle to reduce distractions while keeping the color indicator
- Reset the timer when starting a new task
- Pause the timer during breaks
- The extension automatically pauses when your system is idle
- The settings are synchronized across your Chrome profile
- The overlay works independently on each tab
- Use the opacity slider to find the perfect balance between visibility and non-intrusiveness
- Your opacity settings will sync across all your Chrome instances
- Find your ideal opacity setting based on your screen brightness and website colors
- On dark websites, you might want to use lower opacity values
- On light websites, higher opacity values might work better
- Save different opacity settings for different times of day

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Utilizes Chrome's storage, alarms, idle, and tabs APIs
- Lightweight with minimal performance impact

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `storage`: Save your settings and timer state
- `alarms`: Update the timer every second
- `idle`: Detect system idle state
- `tabs`: Apply the overlay to web pages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timer Not Appearing or Extension not working**
   - Try toggling the "Enable Visual Timer" switch off and on again
   - Refresh the webpage you're trying to use the timer on
   - Make sure you've granted all necessary permissions

2. **Time Display Not Showing**
   - Toggle the "Show Time Display" switch off and then on
   - Check if "Enable Visual Timer" is turned on, as the time display requires the timer to be enabled

3. **Settings Not Syncing**
   - Make sure you're signed into your browser
   - Try closing and reopening your browser
   - Check if you have sync enabled in your browser settings

If these steps don't resolve your issue, please don't hesitate to:
1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/visual-timer/issues/new) with details about:
   - Your browser and version
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
2. Include any error messages from the browser's developer console (F12)
